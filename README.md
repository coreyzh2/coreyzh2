# Data Science Applied Projects For Fun by Corey Huang

### Predicting NBA Shot Selection Using K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm

This is my first self-led project that aims to provide information about player shot selection in the NBA using the KNN Algorithm. In this repo, I've created a detailed [walkthrough](https://github.com/coreyzh2/coreyzh2/blob/main/Notebooks/NBA%20Shooting%20Score%20Analysis%20Project.ipynb) of the steps involved in computing the KNN model for predicting the shot selection of Devin Booker based on his location on the court. 
Data is scraped [here](https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/) and downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wh0801/NBA-16-17-regular-season-shot-log.).

### CO2 Emissions Time Series Analysis

This project provides visualizations and time series analysis for different types of time series plots to explore CO2 emission trends among various countries and sectors. You can view the results of my code for this analysis [here](https://github.com/coreyzh2/coreyzh2/blob/main/Notebooks/co2emission_proj.ipynb). The data was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saloni1712/co2-emissions).

### Linear Regression Analysis: Bubblewrap Production 

This project explores and analyzes a dataset containing various factory operating statistics for bubble wrap production. The construction of multiple linear regression models is conducted to find the best model in representing bubble wrap production rate. The resulting model optimizes the production rate for the factory. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/coreyzh2/coreyzh2/blob/main/Notebooks/BubblewrapProductionProject.Rmd), and the repository containing all the related files, including the analysis report for this project can found [here](https://github.com/coreyzh2/Bubblewrap_project/tree/main).

### NBA Player Statistics Shiny Dashboard

This app allows users to create scatterplots of various NBA player statistics and displays the top Performance Index Rating by certain categories. The HTML page can be found [here](https://coreyzh2.shinyapps.io/NBA_Shiny_Dashboard/) and the data has been provided [here](https://www.sports-reference.com/).

### Top Selling Hip-Hop Artists and Their City of Influence Over the Years

I took a trip to Atlanta, where I quickly realized that the city was the center for American hip-hop today. I was curious as to how this hub changed from its origins in the Bronx to the great city of Atlanta. In this mini-project, my goal was to find out how the place of influence for successful hip-hop artists changed over time. Since there was no available dataset on the most influenctial rappers and their city of musical influence, I web scraped data to find the artists with the most successful albums from 1998-2023. Then, I quickly found their place of musical influence using the old reliable ChatGPT, and did analysis on the place of influence over time. The code for the web scraping portion can be viewed [here](https://github.com/coreyzh2/coreyzh2/blob/main/Notebooks/01scrapeTopSellingRappers.ipynb), and a brief analysis of the results can be viewed [here](https://github.com/coreyzh2/coreyzh2/blob/main/Notebooks/02-analyzeData.ipynb).
