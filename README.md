## Machine Learning Problems.

### Predicting NBA Shot Selection Using K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm.

This is my first self-led project that aims to provide information about player shot selection in the NBA using the KNN Algorithm. In this repo, I've created a detailed [walkthrough](https://github.com/coreyzh2/coreyzh2/blob/main/Notebooks/NBA%20Shooting%20Score%20Analysis%20Project.ipynb) of the steps involved in computing the KNN model for predicting the shot selection of Devin Booker based on his location on the court. 
Data is scraped [here](https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/) and downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wh0801/NBA-16-17-regular-season-shot-log.) 

## Regression problems.

### Effectiveness of Toradol on Patient Recovery After Surgery

This repository consists of logistic regression analysis on the effect that Toradol has on patient bed time and pain levels after surgery. The repository to the source code and the analysis report for this project can found from the link [here](https://github.com/coreyzh2/Ketorolac_Report).

### Bubblewrap Production 

This project aims to analyze a data set related to factory operating conditions and bubble wrap production in order to build multiple linear regression models that optmize bubble wrap production rate. The repository to the source code and the analysis report for this project can found from the link [here](https://github.com/coreyzh2/Bubblewrap_project/tree/main).

## Data exploration and analysis

### NBA Player Statistics Shiny Dashboard

This app allows users to create scatterplots of various NBA player statistics and displays the top Performance Index Rating by certain categories. The HTML page can be found [here](https://coreyzh2.shinyapps.io/NBA_Shiny_Dashboard/) and the data has been provided [here](https://www.sports-reference.com/).
