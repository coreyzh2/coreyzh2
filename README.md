### Predicting NBA Shot Selection Using K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm.

This is my first self-led project that aims to provide information about player shot selection in the NBA using the KNN Algorithm. In this repo, I've created a detailed [walkthrough](https://github.com/coreyzh2/NBA_Shot_Analysis_KNN_Algorithm) of the steps involved in computing the KNN model for predicting the shot selection of Devin Booker based on his location on the court. 
Data is scraped [here](https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/) and downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wh0801/NBA-16-17-regular-season-shot-log.)
