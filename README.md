## Machine Learning Problems.

### Predicting NBA Shot Selection Using K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm

This is my first self-led project that aims to provide information about player shot selection in the NBA using the KNN Algorithm. In this repo, I've created a detailed [walkthrough](https://github.com/coreyzh2/coreyzh2/blob/main/Notebooks/NBA%20Shooting%20Score%20Analysis%20Project.ipynb) of the steps involved in computing the KNN model for predicting the shot selection of Devin Booker based on his location on the court. 
Data is scraped [here](https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/) and downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wh0801/NBA-16-17-regular-season-shot-log.).

## Regression Problems.

### Bubblewrap Production 

This project explores and analyzes a data set containing various factory operating statistics for bubble wrap production. The construction of multiple linear regression models is conducted to find the best model in representing bubble wrap production rate. The resulting model optimizes the production rate for the factory. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/coreyzh2/coreyzh2/blob/main/Notebooks/BubblewrapProductionProject.Rmd), and the repository containing all the related files, including the analysis report for this project can found [here](https://github.com/coreyzh2/Bubblewrap_project/tree/main).

## Data Exploration and Analysis.

### NBA Player Statistics Shiny Dashboard

This app allows users to create scatterplots of various NBA player statistics and displays the top Performance Index Rating by certain categories. The HTML page can be found [here](https://coreyzh2.shinyapps.io/NBA_Shiny_Dashboard/) and the data has been provided [here](https://www.sports-reference.com/).
