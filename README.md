### Predicting NBA Shot Selection Using K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm.

This is my first self-led project that aims to provide information about player shot selection in the NBA using the KNN Algorithm. In this repo, I've created a detailed [walkthrough](https://github.com/coreyzh2/NBA_Shot_Analysis_KNN_Algorithm) of the steps involved in computing the KNN model for predicting the shot selection of Devin Booker based on his location on the court. 
Data is scraped [here](https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/) and downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wh0801/NBA-16-17-regular-season-shot-log.)

### NBA Player Statistics Shiny Dashboard

This app allows users to create scatterplots of various NBA player statistics and displays the top Performance Index Rating by certain categories. The HTML page can be found [here](https://coreyzh2.shinyapps.io/NBA_Shiny_Dashboard/) and the data has been provided [here](https://www.sports-reference.com/).
